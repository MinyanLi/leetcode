# This solution use least memory


# Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. 
# We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but donâ€™t want to store the entire sequence in memory. 
# Yield is used in Python generators. 
# A generator function is defined just like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, 
# it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. 
# If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
